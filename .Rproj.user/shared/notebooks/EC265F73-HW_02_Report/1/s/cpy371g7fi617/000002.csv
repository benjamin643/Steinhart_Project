"0","print(""The graph that I chose is a boxplot that depicts the IQ data by the variable, Smelter, which consists of two categories: far and near. From the boxplot, we can see that the far category has a few outliers but one clear outlier that is not an accurate representation of an individual's IQ. An IQ of 131 or greater is considered very superior (https://www.healthline.com/health/what-is-considered-a-high-iq#whats-a-high-iq). Thus, an IQ of 1000 is likely a data entry error or some other type of error. The table is a simple representation of the median of IQ for each category. The median of the far smelter is 93 and the mean of the near smelter is about 88."") "
